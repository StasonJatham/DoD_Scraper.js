# DoD_Scraper.js
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-crayons.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

## Why?
This script is the beginning of a scraper I wanted to write. Purpose is to gather data oon how much the Department of Defense spends on each compnay, each quarter. I then want to buy Options or stocks and capitalize on this information.

## Test
So I have not tested this and i plan to work on this script when i find the time. I dont know if it is a good strategy or even if it wortks but i am willing to try.

## Contribute
You are welcome to contributee and/or if you know any other data sources for international arms sales i d love to ontegrate it.
